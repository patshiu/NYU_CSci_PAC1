#Lab 1 'Song Lyrics':

Write a program that prints out the lyrics to one or several verses of your favorite song. Be sure to include at least one comment in the program and one escape sequence . Pay attention to formatting using the following codes:

`\n` line break  
`\t` tab  
`\"` double quote  
`\'` single quote  
`\\` backslash  

Make sure you can run the program on the machine you will use for your homework this semester. That means you can compile (i.e. no syntax errors) and run the program.

Please also refer to Oracle's Java style guide for an authoritative guide about writing properly formatted Java code.
